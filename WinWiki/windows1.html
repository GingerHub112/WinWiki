        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Back then, Microsoft Windows was not how we know it today, as an operating system. In fact back then it was a MSDOS graphical user interface overlay. Windows 1.0 required a MSDOS version between of 3.0-6.0. It included: MS-DOS Executive (File Manager), Wordpad (Word Processor), Cardfile (Contacts), Terminal (MSDOS Terminal Emulator), Calculator, Control Panel (Settings), Clock, Calendar, Paintbrush (Nowdays: Paint or MSPaint) and Reversi. It was critised for the tiling windows manager, lack of compatibility with other applications and its slowness. But Microsoft didn’t give up and released afterwards “Microsoft Windows 2.0”. Even with the low succes of Windows at first, Windows is the most used PC operating system, executed on 71.48% of devices.</p>
