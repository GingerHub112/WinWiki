            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>It was a <span class="bold">major Windows update that revolutionized Windows</span>
            (<span class="em">There is another one that revolutionized Windows further</span> 
            and one that was supposed to revolutionize Windows for Tablets <span class="em">but ended up being a <span class="bold">nightmare for desktop users</span></span>); 
            It added further color support, it added some <span class="bold">32-bit support</span>, <span class="bold">MSDOS Executive in two different programs</span>
            (The app launcher is now called <span class="em">Program Executive</span>, the file manager is now <span class="em">Windows Explorer</span> that we all know today, 
            and MS-DOS Executive became <span class="bold">deappreciated and discontinued).</span></p>
