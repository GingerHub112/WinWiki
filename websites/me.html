            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Back then, Microsoft Windows was not how we know it today, as <span class="em">an operating system.</span>
            In fact back then it was a MSDOS graphical user interface overlay. 
            <span class="em">Windows 1.0</span> required a MSDOS version between of 3.0-6.0. 
            It included: MS-DOS Executive (File Manager), 
            Wordpad (Word Processor), 
            Cardfile (Contacts), 
            Terminal (MSDOS Terminal Emulator), 
            Calculator, 
            Control Panel (Settings), 
            Clock, 
            Calendar, 
            Paintbrush (Nowdays: Paint or MSPaint) and Reversi. 
            It was critised for the tiling windows manager, lack of compatibility with other applications and its slowness. 
            But Microsoft didn’t give up and released afterwards “<span class="em">Microsoft Windows 2.0</span>”. Even with the low succes of Windows at first, Windows is the <span class="em">most used PC operating system</span>, executed on 71.48% of devices.</p>
